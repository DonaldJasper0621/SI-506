## 2.0 Lecture data

The American Library Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom (OIF) maintains a list of the
["Top 10 Most Challenged Books of 2023"](https://www.ala.org/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/top10)
in order to highlight censorship in US libraries and schools (2024 figures have yet to be released).
The ALA recorded 1,247 attempts to ban or restrict library resources during 2023. The resources
targeted included 4,240 unique titles&mdash;a 65% increase compared to 2022.

> Pressure groups focused on public libraries in addition to targeting school libraries. The number
> of titles targeted for censorship at public libraries increased by 92% over the previous year,
> accounting for about 46% of all book challenges in 2023.

The ALA reports that the majority of challenges involved works by or about Black or LBGTQIA+
persons. This week's lectures feature challenged works drawn from the ALA "Most Challenged" list.

Other sources consulted include:

* [ALA](https://www.ala.org/). ["Unite Against Book Bans"](https://uniteagainstbookbans.org/).
* [pen.org](https://pen.org/). ["Book Bans"](https://pen.org/issue/book-bans/).

## 3.0 Statements and expressions

A Python program (or script) is a plain text file that is accorded the file extension `.py`. The
program contains, at a minium, one or more _statements_ and _expressions_.

### 3.1 Statement

A Python _statement_ is an __instruction__ that performs some action. For example, assigning a value
to a variable is considered a statement.

```python
office = "ALA Office for Intellectual Freedom"  # variable assignment
```

As you progress through the course you will learn how to harness actions in a program that import
functionality, define objects, determine the flow of execution, return values, and handle exceptions.

### 3.2 Expression

A Python _expression_ is a combination of values, pointers (i.e., variables), operators, and/or
function or method calls that resolve to a value. A statement can include one or more expressions
(the reverse is not true).

```python
# Statements (variable assignments)
x = 2571
y = 4240

# Statement containing the arithmetic expression y - x
diff = y - x

# Also an expression (function call)
print(diff)
```

## 4.0 Comments

Explanatory text known as "comments" can be embedded in code with no impact on the runtime
characteristics of the program or script. In Python single line comments are delinated by prefacing
the line with a hash (`#`) character.

```python
# A single line comment
```

Successive lines of comments are considered a "block" comment.

```python
# A single line comment
# Yet another single line comment
# And yet another single line comment
```

You can also comment code rendering it inert and incapable of being interpreted (i.e., executed) at
runtime.

```python
# x = 5
# y = 2
# sum = x + y
```

You can also place a comment "inline" at the end of a line of code:

```python
url = "https://uniteagainstbookbans.org/"  # ALA initiative
```

:bulb: Later in the course you will be introduced to documentation strings or "docstrings" which are
used to document classes, functions, and methods.

## 5.0 Variables

A Python _variable_ is a name, label or pointer that refers to an object in memory. Jake VanderPlus
describes the concept in _A Whirlwind Tour of Python_:

>“. . . variables are simply pointers [to objects], and the variable names themselves have no attached type information.”

Or as Naomi Cedar writes in _The Quick Python Book_, Third Edition (Manning Publications, 2018):

>"The name variable is somewhat misleading . . .; name or label would be more accurate.”

### 5.1 Variable assignment

Employ the assignment (`=`) operator to _assign_ a value to a variable. The assignment _binds_ the
name (i.e., the pointer or label) to the object (e.g., `variable_name = < object >`).

```python
organization = "American Library Association"  # a string
year_founded = 1876  # an integer
strategic_directions = [
    "Advocacy",
    "Information Policy",
    "Professional & Leadership Development.",
    "Equity, Diversity & Inclusion"
    ]  # a list
```

### 5.2 Variable naming rules and conventions

Default convention: lowercase word(s) or recognizable abbreviation (e.g., `num`, `val`, `var`);
separate words with an underscore (`_`).

:exclamation: Readability and comprehensibility matters. See the Python Community's
[Style Guide for Python Code (PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) (reformatted by Kenneth Reitz).

#### 5.2.1 Good

```python
# Choose lowercase
title = "Beloved"

# Separate words with underscore (_)
banned_author = "Toni Morrison"

# Use plural form to indicate a set or sequence
banned_titles = ["The Bluest Eye", "Beloved", "Song of Solomon"]

# Ok to use recognizable abbreviations like num[ber], val[ue] or var[iable].
num = 1247

# "is_", "has_" prefix: Boolean True/False
is_banned = False
has_mask = True

# All caps designates a module level constant (special case)
BASE_URL = "https://www.ala.org/"

# Function definition specifying two parameters x and y
def add(x, y):
    return x + y  # arithmetic expression

# For loop incorporating a counter < i > value
i = 1 # counter
for title in banned_titles:
    print(f"{i}. {title}")
    i += 1 # addition assignment (increment)
```

#### 5.2.2 Bad (But Legal)

```python
# Opaque
b = "Beloved"
sos = "Song of Solomon"

# Reserve CamelCase for class names, e.g. GraphicMemoir().
GraphicMemoir = "Gender Queer"  # restyle variable as graphic_memoir

# Not a fan of trailing data type suffixes (_list)
banned_authors_list = ["Maia Kobabe", "George M. Johnson", "Mike Curato"] # prefer course_codes (plural)
```

:exclamation: Avoid use of [built-in function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
names as variable names. While not illegal, variable names that "shadow" built-in function names
(e.g., `id`, `len`, `min`, `max`, `list`) undercut code readability and may confuse syntax
highlighters in Python-aware editors like VS Code. On occasion, such usage can also trigger runtime
exceptions:

```python
id = "12345"
print(id(id)) # TypeError: 'str' object is not callable; built-in function id() not recognized
```

Choose a different variable name (e.g., "identifier") or add a trailing underscore character to the
name (`_`) per the [PEP 08](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-method-arguments)
styling guide recommendation.

```python
id_ = "12345"
print(id(id_)) # Built-in function id() executes successfully
```

#### 5.2.3 Ugly (Illegal)

The Python interpreter will raise a `SyntaxError` at runtime whenever it encounters a variable name
that either matches a reserved Python
[keyword](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords), starts with a number
(`0`-`9`), or includes a special character (e.g., `@`, `%`, `$`, `&`, `!`), dash (`-`), or space
(" ").

```python
# Illegal: keyword used as a variable name (language-specific identifiers reserved by Python)
class = "SI 506"

# Illegal: variable name commences with a numeric value.
506_lecture = "SI 506 lecture"

# Illegal: variable name includes a special character
$number = 506
domain@ = "umich.edu"

# Illegal: variable name includes a dash (`-`).
course-list = ["SI 506", "SI 507", "SI 618"]

# Illegal: variable name includes a space.
course name = "SI 506"
```

:bulb: Until you gain experience as a Python programmer avoid prefixing or suffixing variable names
with a single (`_`) or double (`__`) underscores. Variable names prefixed with a single underscore
like `_course_code` are, by convention, considered private member variables in a class. Variable
names prefixed with a double underscore like `__course_code__`, get renamed at runtime by the Python
interpreter in a process known as "name mangling". For additional information on underscore (`_`)
usage see D. Bader,
["The Meaning of Underscores in Python"](https://dbader.org/blog/meaning-of-underscores-in-python)
(dbader.org, nd).

## 6.0 Operators: basic arithmetic

Python supports math operations. The following operators are always available for use.

| Operator | Name | Description |
| :------- | :--- | :---------- |
| + | Addition | |
| - | Subtraction | |
| * | Multiplication | |
| / | (Floating Point) Division | Returns a floating-point value (a `float`) that contains a fractional component (`5 / 2` returns `2.5`).|
| // | Floor Division | Returns an integer (i.e., a whole number) ignoring any fractional component (`5 // 2` returns `2`). |
| % | Modulus | Returns the remainder of a division operation (e.g., `5 % 2` returns `1`).  |
| ** | Exponentiation | Returns the product of a number (the base) multiplied `n` times specified exponent (`2.5 ** 2` returns `6.25`). |

The order of operations is expressed conveniently by the acronym
__PEMDAS__: Parentheses, Exponentation, Multiplication \| Division (same precedence), Addition \|
Subtraction.

1. Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the
   order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, `2 * (3 - 1) = 4`, and
   `(1 + 1) * (5 - 2) = 8`. You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in
   `(minute * 100) / 60`, even though it doesn’t change the result.

2. Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so `2 ** 1 + 1 = 3` and not `4`, and
   `3 * 1 ** 3 = 3` and not `27`.

3. Multiplication and both division operators have the same precedence, which is higher than
   addition and subtraction, which also have the same precedence. So `2 * 3 - 1 = 5` rather
   than `4`, and `5 - 2 * 2 = 1`, not `6`.

4. Operators with the same precedence (except for **) are evaluated from left-to-right. In algebra
   we say they are left-associative. So in the expression `6 - 3 + 2`, the subtraction happens first,
   yielding `3`. We then add `2` to get the result `5`. If the operations had been evaluated from
   right to left, the result would have been `6 - (3 + 2)`, which equals `1`.

:bulb: You can also use the plus (`+`) operator to construct a new string by joining two or more
strings. This is known as string _concatenation_. Next lesson we will show you how to concatenate
other objects like lists and tuples.

```python
firstname = "Toni"
lastname = "Morrison"
fullname = lastname + ", " + firstname
print(fullname) # "Morrison, Toni"
```

### 6.1 Challenges

#### 6.1.1 Challenge 01

__Task__. Write basic arithmetic expressions.

1. Given the numbers `3`, `5`, `7`, and `9` write an arithmetic expression using the integers that
   equals the value `140` (an `int`). Assign the expression to the variable `w` (replace `None`).

   Uncomment the accompanying `print()` call, run your code, and review the output.

2. Given the numbers `2`, `4`, and `8` write an arithmetic expression using the integers that equals
   the value `18.0` (a `float`). Assign the expression to the variable `x` (replace `None`).

   :exclamation: You may need to employ one of the numbers more than once in the expression.

   Uncomment the accompanying `print()` call, run your code, and review the output.

3. Divide `506` by `3` in a way that yields the integer `168`. Assign the expression to the variable
   `y` (replace `None`).

   Uncomment the accompanying `print()` call, run your code, and review the output.

4. If the modulo operation `506 % 2` returns `0` what divisor in the expression `506 % < divisor>`
   will return `2`? Assign the expression to the variable `z` (replace `None`).

   Uncomment the accompanying `print()` call, run your code, and review the output. The correct
   value(s) will be shared at the conclusion of the challenge.

   :exclamation: If you need a quick primer on modulo operations see
   [Modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo) or consult [UMGPT](https://umgpt.umich.edu/).

#### 6.1.2 Challenge 02

__Task__. Assign string values to specified variables. Concatenate variables to create a new string.

Maia Kobabe's memoir _Gender Queer: A Memoir_ (2019) leads the 2023 list of most challenged
books according to the ALA.

1. Assign each of the specified strings to the accompanying variable:

   | Variable | String Assignment | Notes |
   | :------- | :---------------- | :---- |
   | `author` | "Maia Kobabe" | |
   | `title` | "Gender Queer: A Memoir" | |
   | `publisher` | "Lion Forge Comics" | |
   | `pub_date` | "2019" | Number masquerading as a string. |

2. Concatenate `author`, `title`, `publisher`, and `pub_date` by creating an expression that places the plus
   (`+`) operator _between_ each of the four variables. Concatenate the variables in the order
   listed. Assign the expression to a variable named `challenged_book`.

   Uncomment the accompanying `print()` function call, run your code, and review the output. The
   terminal output _must_ match the following string:

   ```commandline
   Maia KobabeGender Queer: A MemoirLion Forge Comics2019
   ```

3. Copy the `challenged_book` variable assignment and paste it below the `print()` function call.

4. Modify the variable assignment's concatenation expression in the following ways:

   * Add a string comprising __a comma _and_ a space__ between `author` and `title`.
   * Add a string comprising __a space and an opening parenthesis__ between `title` and `publisher`.
   * Add __a comma and a space__ between `publisher` and `pub_date`.
   * Append __a closing parenthesis and a period__ to the end of the concatenated expression.

   :exclamation: Inserting additional strings into the expression will require the use of additional
   plus (`+`) operators to ensure that the strings are concatenated properly.

   After revising concatenation expression, uncomment the second `print()` call, run your code, and
   review the output. The terminal output _must_ match the following string:

   ```commandline
   Maia Kobabe, Gender Queer: A Memoir (Lion Forge Comics, 2019).
   ```

## 7.0 Objects: identity, type, value

>"Everything is an Object"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jake VanderPlas, _A Whirlwind Tour of Python_ (O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2016)

> "Objects are Python's abstraction for data. All data in a Python program is represented by objects
> or by relations between objects."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python Software Foundation, ["The Python Language Reference"](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html)

![Python objects](python_objects.png)

Python is an object-oriented programming language. This means that the Python data model represents
strings, integers, floating point numbers, containers (e.g., `list`, `str`, `tuple`), mappings
(`dict`), functions, class instances, modules and other types as __objects__.

The basic characteristics of a Python object can be summarized as follows:

1. Every object possesses an _identity_ (memory address), _type_, and _value_.
2. An object’s _type_ determines its behavior as well as defines the possible values it may contain.
3. The value of some objects can be modified. An object's _mutability_ (e.g., _mutable_ = capable of
   modification; _immutable_ = incapable of modification) is determined by its _type_.
4. Objects are never explicitly destroyed; memory management and "garbage-collection" is typically
   ceded to the Python interpreter without the need for manual intervention.

Listed below is a "starter" set of object types that you will encounter early in the course. Other
object types such as the `range` and dictionary (`dict`) will be introduced later in the course.

### 7.1 NoneType

Represents the absence of a value.

:exclamation: Note that `None` does not equal `0`.

```python
value = None
```

### 7.2 Numeric: integer, floating point number (decimal)

Python supports a broad range of numeric types. Basic types include integers and floating-point
numbers.

#### 7.2.1 Integer (`int`)

Represents whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero).

```python
x = 4240
y = .65
z = -506
```

#### 7.2.2 Floating Point Number (`float`)

Represents real numbers containing a fractional component (i.e., decimal value).

```python
pi = 3.14159
corr_coeff = -0.85
```

### 7.3 Boolean (`bool`)

Represents the _truth_ values `True` or `False`. The boolean `True` is equivalent to `1` while
the boolean `False` is equivalent to `0`.

```python
is_challenged = True
is_banned = False
```

### 7.4 Sequence: string, list, tuple

A sequence is a container consisting of an _ordered_ collection of characters, elements, or items.
Each member of a sequence can be accessed individually or in groups by its index (an integer value).

#### 7.4.1 String (`str`)

A string (type: `str`) is an _ordered_ sequence of characters. Once instantiated (i.e., created),
the string is considered _immutable_ and cannot be modified. The string is also an _iterable_, a
type of object whose members (in this case, characters), can be accessed.

A string is delineated by the use of double (`"..."`) or single (`'...'`) quotation marks.

:bulb: The [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) and [Black](https://github.com/psf/black)
formatter libraries favor use of double quotation marks.

```python
author = "Ellen Hopkins"
```

A string can also be expressed across multiple lines. A "multiline" string (actually a string
constant) can be expressed by the surrounding the string with either _triple_ double
(`"""...""""`) or single (`'''...'''`) quotation marks.

The following example reproduces the first two sentences of Toni Morrison's foreward to the 2007
Vintage International edition of the _The Bluest Eye_, first published in 1970.

```python
intro = """There can't be anyone, I am sure, who doesn't know what it
feels liked to be disliked, even rejected, momentarily or for sus-
tained periods of time. Perhaps the feeling is merely indiffer-
ence, mild annoyance, but it may also be hurt. It may even be
that some of us know what it is like to be actually hated--
hated for things we have no control over and cannot change. . . .
"""
```

The same string can also be expressed across multiple lines by surrounding it with parentheses `()`
and employing the escape sequence (`\n`) to denote each line break.

:bulb: The `\n` characters represents an escape sequence, specifically an ASCII linefeed (LF).
Think of `\n` as "newline". Passing `\n` in a string will insert a new line at the position of the
escape sequence.

```python
intro = (
    "There can't be anyone, I am sure, who doesn't know what it\n"
    "feels liked to be disliked, even rejected, momentarily or for sus-\n"
    "tained periods of time. Perhaps the feeling is merely indiffer-\n"
    "ence, mild annoyance, but it may also be hurt. It may even be\n"
    "that some of us know what it is like to be actually hated--\n"
    "hated for things we have no control over and cannot change. . . ."
)
```

A string instance (i.e., object) possesses behaviors (known as _methods_) that you can leverage.
Examples of these methods are discussed in a later section.

#### 7.4.2 List (`list`)

A list (type: `list`) represents an _ordered_ sequence of _elements_ (i.e., object references). The
list is also an _iterable_, a type of object whose members (in this case, elements), can be accessed.
Unlike a string a Python list is _mutable_ and capable of modification. Elements can be added or
removed from a list and, if the element is mutable, (e.g., a nested list) can be modified. List
elements are accessed by position using a zero-based index value.

A list is delineated by the use of square brackets (`[...]`). Each element in a list is separated
by a comma (`,`).

:bulb: If a list is created "manually"&mdash;as is the case in the example below&mdash;it is known
as a _list literal_.

```python
challenged_books = ["Flamer", "Tricks", "Sold"]  # list literal
```

Like a string, a list instance is also provisioned with methods that permit operations to be
performed by the list. These behaviors are discussed in greater detail in a subsequent lesson.

#### 7.4.3 Tuple (`tuple`)

>"I pronounce tuple too-pull on Mon/Wed/Fri and tub-pull on Tue/Thu/Sat. On Sunday I don't talk about them. 🙂"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guido van Rossum, [Twitter (now X)](https://x.com/gvanrossum/status/86144775731941376) (29 June 2011)

A tuple (type: `tuple`) is an _ordered_ sequence of items. Once created, the tuple is
considered _immutable_ and cannot be modified. The tuple is also an _iterable_, a type of object
whose members (in this case, items), can be accessed. Tuples provide an optimized data structure
for referencing groups of values that form "natural" associations that do not change over the life
of a program or script (e.g., Toni Morrison, Novelist, Nobel Prize in Literature (1993)).

A tuple is delineated by the use of parentheses (`(...)`). Each item in a tuple is separated by a
comma (`,`). Single item tuples _must_ include a
trailing comma.

```python
municipality = ("Ann Arbor", "MI", "USA")
city = ("Ann Arbor",) # single item
```

A tuple instance is also provisioned with methods that permit operations to be performed by the
tuple. These behaviors are discussed in greater detail in a subsequent lesson.

### 7.5 Callable: user-defined and built-in functions

A _callable_ is an object that can be invoked&mdash;optionally with arguments&mdash;to perform a
specified computation. A function (`<class 'function'>`) is a callable comprising a defined block
of code that performs (ideally) a single task.

Functions are considered "first-class" objects in the Python ecosystem.

#### 7.5.1 Defining and calling a user-defined function

A function is defined using the keyword `def` and given a name that ends with parentheses `()`. The
name should be lowercase with words separated by underscores (`_`) to enhance readability.

:bulb: Consider names employing a `< verb >_< noun >` format, such as `convert_to_int`,
`get_resource`, or `read_csv`.

A function may be provisioned with one or more _parameters_. This allows the function to accept
input (known as _arguments_) for processing.

The function declaration line is terminated by a colon (`:`). A function's code block _must_ be
indented, i.e., code intended for execution _must_ be placed inside the block.

```commandline
def <function_name(< parameter_01 >, < parameter_02 >, ...):
   < statement 01 >  # indent
   < statement 02 >  # indent
   ...
```

A function _may_ include a `return` statement that both signals the end of the computation performed
and returns the computed value to the caller.

:exclamation: A function that does not specify a `return` statement returns `None` to the caller.

A function is executed if, and only if, it is called explicitly; otherwise, the function's
code block is ignored by the Python interpreter. Functions can be called multiple times during code
execution&mdash;their presence enhances code modularization and reuse.

In the following example, the function named `multiply` computes the product of the two numbers
passed to it and then returns the computed value to the caller.

```python
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

# Multiply 4 and 6
product = multiply(4, 6) # returns 24
```

Arguments are passed by _position_. In other words, the caller must pass the arguments in the
correct order to ensure that the function can process the values as expected.

In the next example, changing the order of the arguments passed to the function `divide()` changes
the return value:

```python
def divide(x, y):
    return x / y

# Divide 10 by 2
quotient = divide(10, 2) # returns 5.0
quotient = divide(2, 10) # Oops, returns 0.2
```

#### 7.5.2 Built-in functions

The Python standard library includes a number of
[built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) that are always available for
you to call in your code. This week we introduce you to `print()`, `type()`, and `len()`.

#### 7.5.2.1 `print()`

Print object(s) to the text stream (viewable in the terminal).

```python
# Passing a hard-coded string.
print("\nLibraries rock!")  # includes optional newline \n escape character
```

:bulb: Lecture and and problem set code will often include a number of pre-positioned
`print()` functions in which a _formatted string literal_ (a.k.a _f-string_) is
passed to the function as an argument.

The f-string syntax is less verbose and easier to construct than earlier string formatting
approaches. Start by prefixing the string with `f` or `F` before the opening double or
single quotation mark. Then mix in characters, escape sequences, and expressions or variables placed
inside curly braces `{< expression | variable >}`.

```python
library = "University of Michigan Library"
url = "https://www.lib.umich.edu/"
print(f"\nLibrary: {library} ({url})")
```

:bulb: Inclusion of the leading newline escape sequence (`\n`) in the f-string is for terminal
output display purposes only. It is not required but provides a line break between the preceding
output and the output that follows.

You will learn how to write f-strings as well as format strings using older approaches starting
next week.

#### 7.5.2.2 `type()`

Determine an object's data type.

```python
challenge_count = 4240  # unique titles
count_type = type(challenge_count)  # returns <class 'int'>

url = "https://www.ala.org/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/top10"
url_type = type(url)  # returns <class 'str'>
```

#### 7.5.2.3 `len()`

Return the length of a sequence (i.e., number of characters, elements, or items).

```python
char_count = len(url)  # count characters in URL

# Book banning leaders (2022-2023)
state_count = len(["Florida", "Missouri", "North Carolina", "Texas", "Utah"])  # count list elements

#### 7.5.2.4 `round()`

Return a floating point number rounded to `n` decimal places. The caller passes two arguments:

* the number to round
* the number of decimal places permitted.

If the number of decimal places is not specified, the function returns the integer nearest to the
floating point number passed to the function.

In the example below the mathematical constant &Tau; (tau), equivalent to 2&Pi;, is rounded to two
decimal places.

A second example illustrates the function's behaviour if no constraint is placed on the number of
decimal places to retain (i.e., no second argument is passed to the built-in function).

:bulb: Tau (&Tau;) is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius (&Tau; = c / r). Tau is
an [irrational number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number) with no end.

```python
tau = 6.28318530717958647692  # approximation
tau = round(tau, 2)  # returns 6.28

tau = 6.28318530717958647692 # approximation
tau = round(tau)  # returns 6
```

:bulb: Future lectures will build on this brief introduction to functions. You will learn about
optional parameters, keyword arguments, passing a function as an argument, calling a function from
inside another function, anonymous `lambda` functions, documenting function behavior with docstrings,
as well as other built-in functions and object methods.

### 7.6 Challenges

#### 7.6.1 Challenge 03

__Task__: Create __a list of tuples__ that represent the top three (`3`) books targeted for banning
in the US in 2023.

1. Employ a _list literal_ to create a list comprising __three (`3`) tuple elements__. Each four-item
   tuple represents a challenged book comprising the following items: author, title, and challenges.

   | Author (`str`) | Title (`str`) | Challenges (`int`) |
   | :----- | :---- | :--------- |
   | Maia Kobabe | Gender Queer: A Memoir | `106` |
   | George M. Johnson | All Boys Aren't Blue | `82` |
   | Juno Dawson | This Book Is Gay | `71` |

   Assign the list to a variable named `titles`.

2. Right click over your Python file and select "Format Document" or "Format Document With ..."
   (Select Ruff).

   Uncomment the accompanying `print()` call, run your code, and review the output. You list you
   create _must_ be structured as follows:

   ```python
   [< tuple_01 >, < tuple_02 >, < tuple_03 >]
   ```

:exclamation: One book title includes an apostrophe (`'`). Be sure to employ double quotation
marks (`"..."`) rather than single quotation marks (`'...'`) to denote the string. Otherwise, you
will trigger a runtime exception.

#### 7.6.2 Challenge 04

The U-M Library provides ebook and audiobook resources via [UMich OverDrive](https://umich.overdrive.com).
Below are a few samples of challenged books available as audiobooks. Note the duration in hours of each.

| Author | Title | Duration (hrs) | Total Duration |
| :----- | :---- | :------------- | :------------- |
| John Green | [Looking for Alaska](https://umich.overdrive.com/media/4966120) | `6` | 06:40:05 |
| Patricia McCormick | [Sold](https://umich.overdrive.com/media/2299380) | `3` | 03:42:17 |
| Tony Morrison | [The Bluest Eye](https://umich.overdrive.com/media/509204) | `7` | 07:05:49 |

__Task__: Define a function that converts an hour value to minutes. Call the function a number of
times and then sum the values returned by the function calls.

1. Define a function named `hrs_to_mins()`. Provision the function with a single
   parameter named `hours`. Inside the function block provide an arithmetic expression that converts
   the passed in `hours` value to minutes. Employ a `return` statement to return the computed value
   to the caller.

   :bulb: `2`-`3` lines of code is all that is need to implement the function.

2. After implementing `hrs_to_mins()`, call the function, passing it the following argument: hours
   duration value for the novel _Looking for Alaska_. Assign the return value to the variable named
   `alaska`.

3. Call the function a second time, passing it the following argument: hours duration value for the
   novel _Sold_. Assign the return value to the variable named `sold`.

4. Call the function a third time, passing it the following argument: hours duration value for the
   novel _The Bluest Eye_. Assign the return value to the variable named `bluest_eye`.

5. Write an arithmetic expression that sums the minute values. Assign the sum to a variable named
   `total_mins`.

   Uncomment the accompanying `print()` call, run your code, and review the output. The integer
   value _must_ equal `960`.

## 8.0 Object behaviors (a gentle intro)

Many objects possess behaviors. For example, strings, lists, and tuples can be said to exhibit
behaviors that are expressed in the form of _methods_. Think of a method as a type of function
bound directly to an object.

To call an object method, employ the _dot notation_ syntax:

```python
< some_object >.< some_method >()
```

:bulb: We will explore list, tuple, dictionary, and other object methods in the coming weeks.

### 8.1 Select string methods

The [`str`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str) type is provisioned with `40+`
[methods](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp).

Below is a starter set of `str` methods that you can call. You will learn how to leverage
`str` methods as you proceed through the course.

#### 8.1.1 `capitalize()`

Returns a version of the string with the first character capitalized.

```python
event = "banned books week (22-28 September 2024)"
event = event.capitalize()  # Returns "Banned ..."
```

#### 8.1.2 `str.lower()`, `str.upper()`

Returns a version of the string converted to either upper case or
lower case.

```python
title = "Beyond Magenta"
lower_case = title.lower()  # Returns "beyond magenta"
upper_case = title.upper()  # Returns "BEYOND MAGENTA"
```

#### 8.1.3 `str.startswith(substr[, start[, end]])`, `str.endswith(substr[, start[, end]])`

`str.startswith()` returns `True` if the string commences with the specified value while
`str.endswith()` returns `True` if the string ends with the specified value. Optional `start` and `end` positions of type `int` can also be specified to target a subset of the string for inspection. If the substring is not located both methods return `False`.

```python
title = "Out of Darkness"
starts_with_O = title.startswith("O") # Returns True
ends_with_S = title.endswith("S") # Returns False
```

#### 8.1.4 `str.count(substr[, start[, end]])`

Returns the number of times a specified substring `sub` occurs in a string. Optional `start` and
`end` positions of type `int` can also be specified to target a subset of the string for inspection.

```python
# Globally unique identifer (GUID)
guid = "179e7cb5-cc25-4be8-8094-31c9095987e2"

char_count = guid.count("e")  # Returns 3
char_count = guid.count("5-") # Returns 2

char_count = guid.count("e", 0, 9) # Returns 1
```

#### 8.1.5 `str.replace(old, new[, count])`

Returns a new string by replacing the specified substring with a new value. If the optional argument
`count` is provided, only the first `n=count` occurrences are replaced.

:bulb: Python privileges case sensitivity, so ensure that the case of the text to be replaced
matches exactly.

```python
statement = (
    "The American Library Association condemns censorship "
    "and works to ensure free access to information."
)
statement = statement.replace("American Library Association", "ALA")  # "The ALA condemns ....
```

Over the course of the semester you will learn to use a number of `str` methods. For a complete
listing see w3schools'
["Python String Methods"](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp).

### 8.2 Challenges

#### 8.2.1 Challenge 05

__Task__. Employ the appropriate string method to return a count of specified characters or words in
a multiline string.

In 2020 the novelist Jason Reynolds and the historian Ibram X. Kendi published
_Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You_, a young adult "remix" of Kendi's monograph
_Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America_ (2016). The book
quickly emerged as one of the most challenged books of 2020, ranking second on the ALA's annual
list.

The first paragraph of Chapter 01 is reproduced below as a multiline string:

```python
stamped = """BEFORE WE BEGIN, LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT. This is not a history book. I repeat,
this is not a history book. At least not like the ones you're used to reading in school. The ones
that feel more like a list of dates (there will be some), with an occasional war here and there, a
declaration (definitely gotta mention that), a constitution (that too), a court case or two, and, of
course, the paragraph that's read during Black History Month (Harriet! Rosa! Martin!). This isn't
that. This isn't a history book. Or, at least, it's not that kind of history book. Instead, what
this is, is a book that contains history. A history directly connected to our lives as we live
them right this minute. This is a present book. A book about the here and now. A book that hopefully
will help us better understand why we are where we are as Americans, specifically as our identity
pertains to race.
"""
```

1. Utilize the appropriate `str` method introduced above that returns an integer that represents the
   number of times the substring __"book"__ occurs in the multiline string named `stamped`. Assign
   the return value to a variable named `book_count`.

   Uncomment the accompanying `print()` call, run your code, and review the output. The integer
   value _must_ equal `8`.

2. Repeat the operation but this time return an integer that represents the number of times a
   __space__ occurs in the multiline string. Assign the return value to a variable named
   `space_count`.

   Uncomment the accompanying `print()` call, run your code, and review the output. The integer
   value _must_ equal `151`.

3. Employ floating point division to divide `space_count` by the total number of characters in the
   multiline string. Employ a built-in function to return the total number of characters. Assign the
   computed value to the variable named `space_part`.

   Uncomment the accompanying `print()` call, run your code, and review the output. The float value
   _should_ equal `0.1696629213483146`.

4. Call the appropriate built-in function and pass it `space_part` and a second argument that
   ensures that the return value (a `float`) is limited to four decimal places. Assign the computed
   value to the variable named `space_part`.

   Uncomment the accompanying `print()` call, run your code, and review the output. The float value
   _must_ equal `0.1697`.

#### 8.2.2 Challenge 06

__Task__. Return a version of a challenged book title that fixes a typo in the string using the
appropriate string method.

Angie Thomas's debut novel _The Hate U Give_ has been targeted for removal from library
collections nearly every year since its publication in 2017.

1. The string value named `title` contains a typographical error in the book's title. Review the
   string by comparing it to the title listed above.

2. Select the appropriate `str` method introduced above to return a corrected version of the string.
   Assign the return value to the variable `title`.

   Uncomment the accompanying `print()` call, run your code, and review the output. The correct
   string value will be provided at the conclusion of the challenge.

:bulb: Note the object identifier values returned by calling the built-in `id()` function in the
accompany `print()` output. The id change demonstrates that the `title` variable has been reassigned
to a new string object.

#### 8.2.3 Challenge 07

__Task:__ Implement a function that calculates the __percentage change__ of unique book titles
targeted for censorship from 2022 to 2023.

1. Define a function named `pct_change` that specifies two parameters: `x` and `y`. The
   function _must_ calculate the percentage change from `x` to `y` and __return__ the computed
   value to the caller.

   :bulb: If you don't recall how to calculate a percentage value, consult
   [UMGPT](https://umgpt.umich.edu).

2. After implementing `pct_change()` call the function, passing to it the following arguments:

   * 2023 challenges: `4240`
   * 2022 challenges: `2571`

   Assign the return value of the function call to a variable named `surge_pct`.

   Uncomment the accompanying `print()` call, run your code, and review the output. The float value
   should equal `64.91637495138079`.
